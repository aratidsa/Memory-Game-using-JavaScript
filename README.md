# Memory-Game-using-JavaScript

**Memory Game is a single player game where the player has to turn over a pair of matching cards from the deck of cards.**

**I have built Memory Game using JavaScript,HTML and CSS**

**Features**
1)	The number of cards on screen changes with difficulty.

2)	The cards are always different because the images are pulled from an array of 20 images.

**How to Play**
1. Player starts the game by clicking two cards on the deck.

2. If they match, they will remain open. Otherwise, they close down.

3. Player keeps flipping the cards till all the cards are matched and no more cards to flip.
4. The number of stars is the Player's star rating, which is based on the number of moves taken to finish the game.

5. The timer gives the time taken to complete the game.

6. Player can choose one of the following difficulty levels from the 'Difficulty' menu.
  -Easy - 3x2 Grid 
   -Medium - 4x3 Grid
    -Hard - 5x4 Grid

7. When a Player wins or loses the game, a modal appears which tells the Player the score,time taken,number of moves and star rating.

8. The modal also asks if the player wants to continue playing or exit the game.
